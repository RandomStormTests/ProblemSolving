RandomStorm Tech Test
=====================

If you are at this page, then it's likely that a recruiter has forwarded you a link to our technical test. Well done, that means you've passed the first stage, and your CV has been accepted by us. Well done, we think your skills are relevant to our business. That's no small achievement, our process of filtering CV's is riggerous; you have done well to get here.

The next step is a technical test. As you read through the test, you will read this many times, but to start you off easily: We don't want you to write any code.

We are aware that this is not the norm for a technical test, but bear with us. We employ good developers - which means that if they have even got to this step, we know they can probably bash out a good few lines of a good few languages. Because our developers are busy people (and tech tests are reviewed by our developers) we don’t want them to waste time reading through a beautifully abstract and well designed OO solution to some boring problem that’s nothing to do with our business, and nothing to do with what you like doing. So we decided to give you some challanges that are from our business. These are problems that we have already solved, and we want to hear how you would have solved them in our position.

The test itself will have details about what you need to do, but to be short: complete the test then send it back to whomever sent you the link to get here. We will pass it to one of our developers as soon as they’re free and we will get back to you!

You can find the [Problem Solving Tech Test here](tests/ProblemSolving.md).

Good luck!
