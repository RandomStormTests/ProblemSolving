RandomStorm Tech Test
=====================

If you are at this page, then it's likely that a recruiter has forwarded you a link to our technical test. That means you've passed the first stage, and we have accepted your CV. Our process of filtering CV's is rigorous — so you can pat yourself on the back for getting this far!

Our technical test is slightly different from most that you will have faced before: _*We don't want you to write any code.*_

We are aware that this is not the norm for a technical test, but bear with us. We employ good developers — which means that if they have even got to this step, we know they can probably bash out a few good lines of a good few languages. Because our developers are busy people (and tech tests are reviewed by our developers) we don’t want them to waste time reading through a beautifully abstract and well designed OO solution to some boring problem that’s nothing to do with our business, and is likely not very fun to solve. So we decided to give you some challenges that relate to our business. These are problems that we have already solved, and we want to hear how you would have solved them in our position.

The test itself will have details about what you need to do, but to be short: complete the test then send it back to whomever sent you the link to get here.

You can find the [Problem Solving Tech Test here](tests/ProblemSolving.md).

Good luck!
