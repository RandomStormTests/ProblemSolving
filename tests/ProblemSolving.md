#RandomStorm Technical Test

##Problem Solving

Most technical tests are usually "write me this piece of code" or “fix this broken application” however we find that when testing candidates at a higher level, there is a very limited amount that this will tell us about the candidates knowledge. We are much more interested in *how* you would code, rather than us looking at two thousand lines of code you’ve written just to try to impress us.

We have produced two problem solving tests, you do not need to complete both; we want you to complete the one that you feel more comfortable designing a solution for. With that in mind, we are going to give you an abstract problem to solve. Your role with RandomStorm will involve a large amount of architectural problem solving as well as getting down to the nitty gritty and writing the solution. We are a company that believes in building a solution rather than being constrained by concerns of business restriction, so feel free to go as mad as you want with how you solve the problem.

Your choice of programming language is important in this situation. We are a company that uses PHP to solve a number of web and data-handling problems, however both of the problems below can be solved better in other languages than PHP. Perhaps try your hand at solving it in a new language. Remember, we don’t want you to write code, so you don’t need to understand the syntax of the language, only enough about it to be able to tell us how and why you might use it to solve the problem.

### The Problems:

[Problem 1 - The Architect](ProblemSolving/Architect.md): *This is a problem involving some very low level file handling challenges, it is going to test your knowledge and understanding of how your chosen language responds to handling big data, and show us how you solve problems that aren’t the usual ebb and flow of programming.*

[Problem 2 - The Programmer](ProblemSolving/TheProgrammer.md): *We examine lots of data, some of that needs to be statistically analysed against a set of predefined rules. This test gives you a few of those business rules, and asks you to design a software solution to meet those rules, and invent a few of your own.*


## What we want at the end of your chosen problem:

A section of text that describes how you would solve the problem. We want you to be descriptive, we want the solution you devise to be clearly explainable. These problems do not need over-engineering so always try to stick to the KISS principle.

We’re not looking for you to write us any code for this. As we explained previously, although we **_do_** care how you write code, at the level of engineers we employ, you are able to code to a good standard, and what you don’t know, we will be happy to teach you.

The key thing for us is that you enjoy solving these problems. Although this isn’t all that we do, problems like this are the type our team solves every day. We want you to show us how good you are at looking at a problem, breaking it into it’s initial components, and then solving each of those.

You can spend as much or as little time as you want on this. We have had candidates spend entire weekends on this, or just an hour or so. We suggest you put in enough time for you to be happy with the solution that you present back to us.
